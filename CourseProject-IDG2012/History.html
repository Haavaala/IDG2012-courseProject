<!-- pragraphs with history of Fredrikstad  -->

<p>Fredrikstad was founded in 1567 by King Frederik II of Denmark and Norway. It happened during the 
    Nordic Seven Years' War. During this war between Denmark-Norway and Sweden, the Swedes burned Sarpsborg,
    which King Olav the Saint had founded in 1016. The population of the burnt-down town therefore wanted to 
    make the new town less vulnerable to future attacks. In 1569, the new name "Fredriksstad", named after the king,
    was adopted after the old "Sarpsborg". Therefore, the founding of Fredrikstad can be seen as a rebuilding of 
    Sarpsborg. The area of Gleng, where the old town had been located, was legally and administratively added to 
    Fredrikstad.</p>

<p>During the Great Nordic War (1700-1721), the archipelago fleet was based in Fredrikstad from 1709.
    It was under the command of Admiral Peter Wessel Tordenskiold (1690-1720).
    Halden was a charging station under Fredrikstad until 1665, and Moss was a charging station under Fredrikstad 
    from 1670 to 1720. Gleng was part of Fredrikstad from 1567 to 1825, while the Sarpsborg area was otherwise part
    of Fredrikstad until 1839. The restoration of Sarpsborg took place partly at Fredrikstad's expense.</p>

    <p>Along Glomma's bank you constantly come across Fredrikstad's history through brickworks and sawmills,
        which usually lay side by side. "Narnte brickworks" in Selbak, for example, supplied the red brick in its day
        which the university buildings at Blindern in Oslo are built in. Another example is Valle Bruk on Rolvsøy.
        Nylende is located in the municipality of Rolvsøy. The name Nylende comes from the Norse nylenda which means "new land",
        in the sense of newly cultivated land or new residence. From Hauge on Rolvsøy comes Hans Nielsen Hauge,
        nationally known as a lay preacher and industrial entrepreneur. On Rolvsøy you can find "Østfoldhallen" today,
        where a number of sports activities are carried out. In recent times, it has been renamed "Østfoldhallene",
        as several stores have been established in the same area. This was formerly a large open landscape,
        but has subsequently become a large trading area.</p>
